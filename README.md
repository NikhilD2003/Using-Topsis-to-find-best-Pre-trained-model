# Using-Topsis-to-find-best-Pre-trained-model
# Description
The goal is to use TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to rank and select the best pre-trained model for calculating sentence similarity. Pre-trained models provide embeddings (numerical representations) for sentences, and the similarity is computed using mathematical techniques.
# Steps
1. Understanding Sentence Similarity
2. Pre-Trained Models for Sentence Similarity
3. Performance Metrics for Evaluation
4. Applying TOPSIS for Ranking
